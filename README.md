# DiscordNameColorBot

A discord bot to allow users of a discord server to alter their name color in a safe manner.

Usually, in order to set one's name color one needs the "Manage Roles" permission. This is unsafe because users who have this permission can then change other users' roles. This leads to chaos eventually. Now you can simply create a Bot with the "Manage Roles", "Read Messages", & "Send Messages" permissions and you can have the Bot change colors for the users. Much safer!

This Bot is written in Go and uses DiscordGo (https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo).

This is still a work in progress but when it is complete, there will be simplified instructions on adding this bot to your server as well!
